// heap is complete binary tree and non linear data structure
// heap is of two types mix heap and min heap
// max heap: child nodes has always lover value then parent node
// min heap: child nodes has always greater value then parent node
// parent node  = i/2 where i is index
// left node = 2*i where i is index
// right node = 2*i+1 where i is index
